## About Us

Octopi AI delivers cutting-edge artificial intelligence solutions tailored to transform your business operations and
strategic capabilities. We harness advanced technologies to solve complex problems across industries.

### Who We Are

With extensive expertise spanning the AI and AI Agent landscapes, former leaders from industry giants like Amazon Web
Services, Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, and Wiz, co-founders Taz Ahmed and TJ Khan have united their complementary
talents to establish Octopi AI.

Their shared vision addresses the rapidly evolving intersection of AI agency and security resilience. As autonomous
systems become increasingly ubiquitous, Octopi AI pioneers a new paradigm where agentic AI is architected with security
as its foundation—not an afterthought. This innovative approach ensures that as intelligent systems gain greater
autonomy and capability, they maintain rigorous protection standards through every interaction, decision, and execution
cycle.
